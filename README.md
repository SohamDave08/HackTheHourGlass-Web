# Hack The HourGlass - Web

<p>This repository was made in use of a Hackathon</p>

<p>Team Name: Breaking Codes</p>
<p>Track: Health Care</p>

  We plan to create a maximum contact-less autonomous system where the patients' records could be available only by a scan of QR code. So no more hassles of managing all these paperwork, since it will all be synced to your mobile number, so no worries of ever losing your records. Alongside highlighting the issue of appointments to plan to create an appointment scheduler, so the patient can book his slot with a particular doctor all by a few button clicks. A bot that reminds the doctor of his daily schedule and on the patient side set up the remainder of his time of appointment. To tackle the issue of mental health we plan to create a dairy system that intuitively(in the sense understands even emojis)Talk with the subject if his day has been a low party with him in his highs, message his close relatives to catch up on him. Suggest Good Spotify playlists to cheer up his mood since music is that universal language that everyone connects to, which will help to bring the mind to peace and perhaps even prevent that split-second decision. All in all, it is the personâ€™s reflection that dragged him out from the dungeons of darkness. Last but not the least an automated chatbot that recommends your precautions based on the symptoms one enters.
